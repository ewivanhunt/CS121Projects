## Introduction

Projects that were worked on show the basic functions of Data Structures and Objects covered in class. Each project shows a basic function and process that can be performed in IntelliJ. For, while, and if/else loops are shown as well as the random utility in these various projects.

## Features

ESPGame.java goes through a game to guess the color from a random list. The random color is put through a for loop that the user can go through multiple rounds to see if they guessed what the computer guessed. If the player guesses the color it adds it to the matched category and if not it goes into the mismatched category using the if/else loop.
HotelOccupancy.java works with a for loop to match up the total rooms and the total of occupied rooms. With this the system prints out a hotel occupancy summary with the total rooms and occupied rooms all together to show occupancy within the hotel.
WordGame.java works with Strings and variables. The assigned strings are then input into a story that is printed out containing all the asssigned variables in the code.
TestClassActivity.java, Ethan.java, and Drive.java are all projects that work together to print out a person's age, name, and family as well as the car make, model and year. The TestClassActivity.java is then ran to compile it all together to print out both the information of the car and the person.
GuessingGame.java goes through the same random guessing that ESPGame.java goes through. The guessing game chooses a random number between 1 and 100 and the player will go through the game guessing a number until they get the correct number. There are while and if/else loops that gives the player an answer that is "too high" or "too low" to the correct number. If "q" is selected then the game ends and the number is shown. 
RestaurantSelector.java goes through an if/else loop to give an output of a list of restaurants based on the choices of the user. Whether the party is vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free, the user can choose a "yes" or "no" prompt to give a list of fitting restaurants for a good choice based on dietary restrictions.


## Installation

Java shoud be installed as well as IntelliJ. Any jdk after 11 will perform. https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows will lead you to the install of jdk-17. https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/ this link will lead to the IntelliJ install to run the projects. TestClassActivity.java, Drive.java, and Ethan.java are all run together.
